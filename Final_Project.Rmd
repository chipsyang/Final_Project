## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
features <- read.csv('features.csv')
train <- read.csv('train.csv')

library(readxl)
library(xlsx)
Dept_Names <- readxl::read_xlsx('department codes.xlsx')

DF <- merge(features, train, by = c("Store","Date"))
Walmart <- left_join(DF, Dept_Names, by = "Dept")

ggplot(Walmart, aes(x = Temperature, y = Temperature)) + geom_point()
```
